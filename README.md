# No More Brackets (NMB)
This is a chat mod for Minecraft version 1.19.2 that removes the ``"< >"`` brackets around player names in the chat. These brackets were added in the vanilla game's new chat reporting system, but can be distracting for some players. With this mod, players can enjoy a cleaner chat experience without the distraction of unnecessary brackets.
